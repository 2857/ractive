# Support Policy

This is the current Ractive support policy. This policy is adhered to as closely as is possible.

## Maintenance

Starting with version `0.8.0`, the last two released version series of Ractive will be actively maintained, meaning that the `0.8` series receives updates until the release of `0.10.0`. When a new version series is released, it is moved to a maintenance branch as soon as development starts on the next version series. When bugs are fixed on a maintenance branch, the changes are cherry-picked onto other actively maintained branches as necessary. With the `edge` version of Ractive, this means that there are up to three branches that recieve new commits at a time.

New patch-level releases are cut periodically on maintained series if there are un-released bug fixes available.

## Experimental features

Major new features in new versions of Ractive will most likely be labelled as "experimental". This allows feedback to shape major new features more effectively without introducing surpising breakage in future versions. Most experimental features should stabilize in the following version. This means that major new features introduced in `0.9.0` are typically stable with the release of `0.10.0`.

## Version numbers

Ractive has not yet reached maturity, and therefore uses pre-release version numbering. Even so, minor version numbers (`0.8.0`, `0.9.0`, etc) are treated as major, and as such, will not introduce any _intentionally_ breaking changes. Patches and minor-level updates are handled with patch-level relases e.g. `0.8.1`, `0.9.1`, etc.

## Current support

The currently supported version series are: `0.8`.
