<p><strong>Input</strong> and <strong>textarea</strong> elements can update Anglebars data without you having to bother adding event listeners. Just add a <em>data-bind</em> attribute corresponding to the data you want to keep updated.</p>
<p>By default, the data will be updated every time the content of the input changes, because under the hood we're binding to both <em>change</em> and <em>keyup</em> events. Sometimes that's undesirable and you only want to react to <em>change</em> events (i.e. when the user hits Enter or tabs out of the input) &ndash; if that applies, pass in <em>lazy: true</em> as an initialization option.</p>
