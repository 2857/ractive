  "readme": "# gobble\n\n**the last build tool you'll ever need**\n\n## Quick start\n\nInstall [gobble-cli](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble-cli)...\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g gobble-cli\n```\n\n...then [create a gobblefile.js build definition](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/How-to-write-a-gobblefile) in your project's root directory. Then, run gobble:\n\n```bash\ngobble\n```\n\n## Why another build tool?\n\nThere are many good reasons! [Here are a few.](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/Why-another-build-tool%3F)\n\n\n## Docs\n\n* [How to write a gobblefile](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/How-to-write-a-gobblefile)\n* [API reference](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/API-reference)\n\n\n## Plugins\n\nSearch for 'gobble' on npm to find plugins: https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=gobble\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nGobble is still in active development, and may not be ready for primetime yet - APIs may change, and huge swathes of documentation are currently missing. Bear with me!\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Licensed. Copyright 2014 Rich Harris.\n",
